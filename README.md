Project Two Summary and Problem Solved
Project Two involved developing an investment growth application for Airgead Banking, which partnered with a local high school to teach students financial responsibility. The program helps users visualize how their investments will grow over time, focusing on compound interest. By providing an interactive system, students can better understand the importance of saving, investing, and making informed financial decisions.
What I Did Well
I structured the program using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, ensuring modularity and reusability. My code follows best practices, including clear naming conventions and in-line comments for maintainability. I also implemented input validation to prevent incorrect data entry, which improves user experience and program reliability.
Areas for Enhancement
I could optimize my code by improving data handling efficiency, particularly in how investment calculations are performed. Using better memory management techniques, such as smart pointers, could improve security and prevent memory leaks. Additionally, implementing multi-threading for performance-heavy calculations could make the program more responsive.
Challenges and Overcoming Them
One of the most challenging aspects was ensuring accurate compound interest calculations while keeping the program flexible for different input values. I overcame this by breaking the problem into smaller functions and testing each independently. Debugging tools and online financial formulas helped validate my calculations.
Tools and Resources for Support
To support development, I relied on resources like C++ documentation, online tutorials, and debugging tools such as GDB. I also used Git for version control to track changes and ensure collaboration readiness.
Transferable Skills
This project reinforced my understanding of OOP, algorithm optimization, and user input validationâ€”skills that are crucial for any software development project. Additionally, my experience with writing maintainable and secure code will be valuable in future coursework and professional development.
Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure maintainability, I used clear variable names, in-line comments, and modular code design. The program follows a structured format, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones. By adhering to industry best practices, this codebase can be easily maintained or expanded upon in the
